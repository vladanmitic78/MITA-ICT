The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack consulting website for MITA ICT with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Initially, a mock frontend was developed, adhering to a dark theme playbook. Subsequently, the backend was implemented, integrating email services (SMTP), reCAPTCHA, and JWT-based admin authentication. The work involved significant UI/UX refinements based on user feedback, including dynamic content management for services, SaaS products, and the About Us page, as well as fixing contact form submission issues and dropdown styling. Security features like hiding admin access and password changes were added. The current ongoing task addresses three user issues: admin login on browsers, making Our Expertise editable on the About Us page, and adding social media meta tags. The engineer has started implementing fixes for the browser login and expertise editing, with meta tags as the next item.
